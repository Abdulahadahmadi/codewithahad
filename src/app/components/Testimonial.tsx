          <p>Abdul Ahad Ahmadi is a passionate and hardworking programmer with a creative mind. Abdul Ahad has helped me on many projects and it was very helpful to have him arround. He is the go-to resource for me whenever I have any issue on my projects. I really appreciate his help and being such a friendly person. As someone who has helped me a lot not only with my projects but about the sources and paths to take to improve my programming skills, I hardly recommend him.</p>
